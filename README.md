# HackathonTemplate

### What's in the box

* Core Data
* AFNetworking
* .gitignore
* HackathonTemplate-Prefix.pch, with debug macros
* Parse SDK (Files are included)
* My undying love

### Requirements

* CocoaPods. ``$ sudo gem install cocoapods``

### How to use

* Fork this repo (Good job! You just setup the repo for the team!)
* Add teammates [instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)
* ``cd`` to directory
* ``pod install``
* Use the .xcworkspace file, not the .xcproject file.
* You'll have a 'single view application', from which you can expand on.
* See Parse [docs](https://www.parse.com/docs) and [tutorials](https://www.parse.com/tutorials) for some guidance!
* Have fun!
